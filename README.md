### LOKIüßôüèæ

A CLI text file encryption tool.

Turn any text file into an intelligible mess of characters and then back to its original form with a simple password. And now your txt file is a vault.

Trivia: In Swahili, loki is a bastardization of the English word "lock" and it it means...lock üòë. And since you're very likely to find mischief where you find encryption...

<h3 style="color:red">Important!</h3>  

- This tool is not battle tested. It uses python standard library's module "Cryptography" to encrypt and decrypt. It is Fernet encryption to be precise.  
- It is meant to be used on text based files although it might work on many other file types.
- don't forget your password/key.
